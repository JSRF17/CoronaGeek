This is a remake (clone if you will) of the game: They Need To Be Fed (published by YoYoGames).

The purpose of this clone is for 'learning' purposes ONLY.  The goal is to examine the mechanics of the game, not to produce a full reproduction of the original.

'They Need To Be Fed' is the first in what is (as of today) a three game series.  You can find the latest copy of these games on Google Play and the iTunes store.

PLAY THESE GAMES.  They are a lot of fun, challenging, and whimsical.  i.e. What we all wish our games were like.
