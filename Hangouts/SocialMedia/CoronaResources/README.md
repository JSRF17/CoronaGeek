Useful Social Media Resources
============
This folder contains a number of resources taken directly from the Corona site, samples, and or gitHub.  That means these copies may be out of date.  If you suspect this is true, keep reading and locate more recent copies using the links below.

I am merely putting them here so we can talk about them on the show and you will have immediate access to the same code I talked to/about.
