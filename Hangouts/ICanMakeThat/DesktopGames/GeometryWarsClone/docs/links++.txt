  -- Not exactly like game.

- Obstacles - Black holes are both obstacles and strategic elements.  They appear randomly at higher difficulties.  
  -- Firing on them activates them.
  -- Once activated, they stay alive for a fixed amount of time, sucking in anything nearby, including enemies and player.
  -- Firing at an activated hole for a prolonged period will destroy it.
